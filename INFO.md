# Advanced Account Copy Group Memberships

This form lets users copy group memberships from a source AD account to a target AD account. This is particularly useful for new accounts created by HelloID Service Automation. 

## Business Benefits

Users can update an account's group memberships without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved. Additionally, this form's "smart copy" of group memberships increases business efficiency.
