# Advanced Account Copy Group Memberships

This form copies group memberships from a source AD account to a target AD account. This is particularly useful for setting up new accounts created by HelloID Service Automation.

## Business Benefits

This form can copy an account's group memberships without direct access to AD. By controlling access to AD, security is improved. Additionally, this form's "smart copy" functionality increases business efficiency.
